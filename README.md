## Current conclusion — v0.2.0

**Zero properties qualify under either investment-gated lens.** The former two Top 10 lists are now historical research priorities in the pending pool, not approved investment recommendations. The threshold was not relaxed to fill a list.

The pool contains 37 properties. Round one revisited all 20 former shortlist properties and screened 3 replacement prospects; 14 reserve properties retain the earlier evidence and are explicitly not presented as newly reviewed. Missing site rights, utility capacity, scoped costs, measured paying demand and contractual terms prevent qualification. No outreach, site visit or utility application is represented as completed.

Both the network-value and investor lenses now require:

- Verified site control, grid/tariff, complete costs, demand/pricing, permits/access and commercial terms.
- Base-case payback within **6 years** and conservative-case payback within **8 years**, measured from first capital spend.
- Nonnegative base NPV at a **10% real discount rate**, with **10 operating years after construction**, and positive conservative cash after the replacement allowance.

These are explicit underwriting choices, **not an industry standard, Tesla investment policy or a promised return**. [Read the derivation and limitations](docs/ECONOMICS.md).

## What the product does

- Switch between network and investor lenses, and between qualified, pending and excluded pools.
- Inspect exact property addresses, existing supply, round-one findings, missing evidence and source links.
- Review conservative/base/optimistic calculations for every property, including capital, operating costs, construction holding costs, ramp, replacement allowance, NPV and payback.
- Compare up to three properties, export the current view to CSV, or download a two-page brief.
- Switch the application between English and Chinese. English is the default on each page load.

**The per-property numbers are regional-benchmark stress scenarios, not site forecasts.** Electricity varies by state using official commercial averages; unmeasured demand and unquoted construction costs remain shared assumptions. Same-state outputs are intentionally identical rather than fabricated. All 37 reference scenario sets fail the combined numeric hurdle; missing evidence independently blocks admission. A failed hypothetical case does not prove that the actual parcel must lose money.

## Reproduce and update

Requires Node.js 22+ and Python 3. No package installation, secret API key or paid service is needed to run the application or checks.

```sh
npm start
# http://127.0.0.1:4173
npm run check
```

The app uses frozen public-source data and vendored Leaflet. Map tiles come from OpenStreetMap with attribution. It has no login, analytics, uploads or AI API calls, and uses no persistent application storage. The optional PDF generator uses ReportLab and a licensed local Unicode font.
